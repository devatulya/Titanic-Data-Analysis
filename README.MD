# 🛳️ Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 📂 Project Files
- `Titanic_Data_Analysis_With_Saves.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook  
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` → Cleaned dataset saved from notebook  
- `*.png` → Visualization images (saved plots like survival_count.png, age_distribution.png, etc.)  

---

## 🔍 Highlights
- Data cleaning & handling missing values  
- Feature engineering (`family_size`, `alone`, `age_group`)  
- Detailed EDA with **20+ visualizations** (countplots, violin, swarm, KDE, heatmap, pairplot, etc.)  
- Group-wise insights with pivot tables & crosstabs  
- NumPy-based statistical analysis  
- Final summary of key findings  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devatulya/Titanic-Data-Analysis.git
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (with Jupyter extension).
3.Run all cells to reproduce analysis & plots.

📊 Key Insights
- Women had a much higher survival rate than men.

- First-class passengers had the highest survival chances.

- Passengers traveling alone were less likely to survive.

- Children and teens had higher survival rates compared to seniors.

- Higher fare-paying passengers (wealthier) had better survival chances.
